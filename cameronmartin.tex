\section{\Frechet spaces}
Let $X$ be a topological vector space with topology $\T$. A few preliminary definitions:
\begin{definition}
A set $C$ is called
\begin{itemize}
\item balanced if for all $x\in C$ and all $|\lambda| \leq 1$ also $\lambda x \in C$.
\item convex if for all $x, y\in C$ and all $0\leq t \leq 1$, also $tx+(1-t)y\in C$.
\item absorbent if $\bigcup_{t>0} tC = X$.
\item absolutely convex, if $C$ is both convex and balanced. This is the same as saying that for every $x,y\in C$ and real numbers $|t|+|s|=1$, $tx+sy \in C$. The best image for this is that $C$ contains every parallelogramm with vertices $x$ and $y$ symmetric to the origin.
\end{itemize} 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
\begin{itemize}
\item A collection of sets $\mathcal B \subset \T$ is called a base of the topology $\T$ if for every open set $U\in\T$ there is a $B\in \mathcal B$ with $B\in U$.
\item A collection of sets $\mathcal B_x \subset \T$ is called a local base at $x$ of the topology $\T$ if for every neighborhood $U\in\T$ of $x$ (i.e. $x\in U$) there is a $B\in \mathcal{ B}$ with $B\in U$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

We are going to compare two definitions of locally convex spaces.

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{definition}\label{def:l1}
A topogical vector space $X$ is called \textit{locally convex} if the origin has a local base of absolutely convex absorbent sets.
\end{definition}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{definition}\label{def:l2}
A topological vector space $X$ is called \textit{locally convex} if there is a family of seminorms generating the topology.
\end{definition}
\end{minipage}

\begin{lemma}
Definitions \ref{def:l1} and \ref{def:l2} are equivalent.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
{\textit{Proof of \ref{def:l1} $\Rightarrow$ \ref{def:l2}.}}
Define the Minkowski gauge of a set $C\in X$ as 
\[\mu_C(x) = \inf\{\lambda> 0: x\in \lambda C\}.\]
Then we can show that the origin's local base of absolutely convex absorbent sets $\mathcal{B}_0 = \{B_a, a\in I\}$ constitute a family of seminorms via their Minkowski gauges $\{\mu_{B_a}, a\in I\}$ and the latter generates the topology of $X$. XXX

{\textit{Proof of \ref{def:l2} $\Rightarrow$ \ref{def:l1}}}
Using the family of seminorms we can easily build a local base of absolutely convex absorbent sets for the origin.XXX
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}\label{rem:locconv}

\begin{enumerate}
\item In Definition \ref{def:l2}, note that the family of seminorms is not necessarily countable.
\item If the family of seminorms $\|\cdot\|_k$ generating the topology is \textit{countable}, then this constitutes a pseudometric generating the topology. To see this, define
\begin{equation} d(x,y) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty 2^{-k} \frac{\|x-y\|_k}{1+\|x-y\|_k}.\label{eq:metric}
\end{equation}
Note that this pseudo	metric is neither unique (so the metrization is not unique) nor homogenous (so we can't define a suitable norm). 
\item As translation is continuous in any t.v.s, we can use a base for the origin as a base for any point by translation.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:hausdorff}
Let $X$ be a locally convex TVS with its family of seminorms $(\| \cdot \|_\alpha)_{\alpha\in I}$. Then $X$ is Hausdorff if and only if
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hausdorff}
\forall \alpha\in I:~ \|x\|_\alpha = 0\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad x = 0
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $X$ be Hausdorff. We show \eqref{eq:hausdorff}. If for every $\alpha\in I$, $\|x\|_{\alpha}=0$ and we assume that $x\neq 0$, we know by the Hausdorff property that there exists an open neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ and another open neighborhood of $0$ such that they do not intersect. As the topology is generated by the seminorms, we can set $U_x = \{u:~ \|u-x\|_{\alpha} < \eps~ \forall k\leq K\}$ for some $K\in \N, \eps>0$. Now obviously $0\in U_x$ as $\|x\|_{\alpha} = 0$ for all $\alpha$. Hence there cannot exist any neighborhood of $0$ such that we can separate $x$ and $0$. The other direction of \eqref{eq:hausdorff} is obvious by the definition of seminorms.

Now suppose \eqref{eq:hausdorff} holds. If we set $x\neq y$, by \eqref{eq:hausdorff} we know that there is at least one $\alpha\in I$ such that $\|x-y\|_\alpha = M \neq 0$.

By setting $U_x =\{u\in X:~\|u-x\|_\alpha < M/2 \}$ and $V_y =\{v\in X:~\|v-y\|_\alpha < M/2 \}$, we have $U_x\cap V_y = \emptyset$ by the triangle inequality (assume there is a $w$ both in $U_x$ and $V_y$, then one can show that $\|x-y\|_\alpha \leq \|x-w\|_\alpha + \|w-y\|_\alpha < M$).
\end{proof}

We are going to compare two definitions of Fr\'echet spaces.\newline

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{definition}\label{def:f1}
A \Frechet space $X$ is a topological vector space $X$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is locally convex, i.e. $0\in X$ has a local base of absorbent and absolutely convex sets.
\item The topology $\T$ can be induced by a translation invariant metric $d$, i.e. $d(x+a, y+a) = d(x, y)$.
\item $(X, d)$ is a complete metric space.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{definition}\label{def:f2}
A \Frechet space $X$ is a topological vector space $X$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item The topology can be induced by a countable family of seminorms $\|\cdot \|_k$, i.e. $U$ open if and only if for all $u\in U$ there is an integer $K \geq 0$ and an $\eps > 0$ such that \[\{v: \|v-u\|_k<\eps:~ k\leq K\} \subset U\]
\item $X$ is Hausdorff.
\item $X$ is complete w.r.t. the family of seminorms $\|\cdot\|_k$, i.e. if $(x_m)_m$ is a Cauchy sequence w.r.t. all seminorms, then there exists an $x\in X$ with $x_n\to x$ w.r.t. $\|\cdot \|_k$ (and by property 2 even $x_n\to x$).
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\end{minipage}

\begin{remark}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Note that the items 1-3 are not all ``parallely equivalent", but as a set, they are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item \ref{def:f1}.1 and \ref{def:f1}.2 $\Rightarrow$ \ref{def:f2}.1 (the countability property of the family of seminorms is stronger than plain local convexity)
\item \ref{def:f1}.2 $\Rightarrow$ \ref{def:f2}.2 (metrizability implies Hausdorff)
\item \ref{def:f2}.1 and \ref{def:f2}.2 $\Rightarrow$ \ref{def:f1}.2
\item \ref{def:f2}.1$\Rightarrow$ \ref{def:f1}.1 
\item \ref{def:f1}.3 $\Leftrightarrow$ \ref{def:f2}.3
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}
\begin{lemma}
Definitions \ref{def:f1} and \ref{def:f2} are equivalent.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\textbf{\ref{def:f1} $\Rightarrow$ \ref{def:f2}.}

ad 1.): From the equivalent definitions of locally convex vector spaces we know that \ref{def:f2}.1 is \textit{almost} local convexity. The trouble is that we claim the existence of a \textit{countable} family of seminorms whereas local convexity just gives some family of seminorms. By combining \ref{def:f1}.1 (local convexity in its set-theoretic version) and \ref{def:f1}.2 (metrizability), we obtain \ref{def:f2}.1.

Indeed, the metric $d$ allows us to define small balls $B_n = \{x:~ d(x,0)< \frac{1}{n}\}$ for each $n\in\N$. As the topology can be induced by $d$, we know that there is an open set inside each $B_n$ and by local convexity we know of the existence of an absorbent and absolutely convex set $C_n \subset B_n$. Those sets in turn define via their Minkowski gauges $\mu_n$ a countable family of seminorms. Equivalence of the topology of $X$ and the topology generated by the family $\mu_n$ follows from the fact that the $C_n$ are a local base of the topology of $X$.

ad 2.): Every metric (or metrizable) space is Hausdorff.

ad 3.): This is a direct consequence of completeness of $d$.

\textbf{\ref{def:f2} $\Rightarrow$ \ref{def:f1}}
ad 1.): As noted above, \ref{def:f2}.1 is slightly stronger than \ref{def:f1}.1.

ad 2.): By \ref{def:f2}.2 we know by lemma \ref{lem:hausdorff} that the countable family of seminorms in \ref{def:f2}.1 fulfills
\[\forall n\in \N:~ \|x\|_k = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad x = 0.  \] 
This property makes the pseudometric in \eqref{eq:metric} (which is one possible pseudometrization) a proper metric. The fact that the topology of $X$ is induced by $d$ is equivalent to \ref{def:f2}.1.
\end{proof}
\section{The space $\R^\infty$}
\begin{lemma}
The topological vector space $\R^\infty = \{(x_n)_{n\in\N}: ~x_n\in\R:~\forall n\in\N \}$ with the product topology (i.e. the topology generated by all sets of the form $U_1\times\cdots\times U_m\times \R^\infty$ with all $U_i\subset \R $ open) is a \Frechet space. One possible metrization is
\begin{equation}
d(x, y) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}2^{-n}\cdot \frac{|x_n-y_n|}{1 + |x_n-y_n|}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We will prove this by showing that $\R^\infty$ fulfills every item in definition \ref{def:f2}.

ad 1.): We define $\|x\|_k := |x_k|$, i.e. the absolute value of the $k$-th item. This is obviously a seminorm on $\R^\infty$. We show that the product topology an be generated by this family of seminorms. 

Let $U'$ be an open set in the product topology. Then $U'$ is a union of sets of the form $U_1\times\cdots\times U_m\times \R^\infty$. It suffices to consider only open sets out of this basis. Let $U = U_1\times\cdots\times U_m\times \R^\infty$. Choose a point $u\in U$, i.e. $u = (u_1, \ldots, u_m, u_{m+1},\ldots)$ where $u_i \in U_i$ for $i=1,\ldots, m$. Define $\delta = \min_{i=1}^M \dist(u_i, \del U_i)$, where $\dist$ is the distance function on $\R$. Then the set $\{v: \|v-u\|_k < \delta: k\leq M\} $ is a subset of $U$, which constitutes the first part of Definition \ref{def:f2}.1. The other direction is obvious by definition of the product topology.

ad 2.): By lemma \ref{lem:hausdorff} we know that we only need to show that if and only if for given $u\in\R^\infty$ and all $n\in \N$ we have $\|u\|_k = |u_k| = 0$, then $u=0\in\R^\infty$. But this is obvious.

ad 3.): This is easily shown by using completeness of $\R$ in each dimension of $\R^\infty$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
The space $\R^\infty$ with the product topology is a polish space.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
$\R^\infty$ is separable as $\Q^\infty$ is countable and dense and it is completely metrizable by definition of \Frechet spaces.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
The product topology of $\R^\infty$ cannot be generated by a norm. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Open sets of $\R^\infty$ are necessarily unbounded but balls defined by any norm must be (by definition) bounded.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
The Borel $\sigma$-algebra is the same as the product $\sigma$-algebra.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The Borel-$\sigma$-algebra is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by open sets (i.e. sets of the form $U_1\times\cdots\times U_m\times \R^\infty$), which is the same as the product $sigma$-algebra.
\end{proof}
